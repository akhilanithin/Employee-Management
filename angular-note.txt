            Angular - Front End Technology (Single page Application)
                    --------------------------------------

                Basic Commands
            ----------------------

        1. to creata a project: ng new project-name
        2. to run a project : ng serve, to view in browser: http://localhost:4200/
        3. to create component: ng g c component-name
        4. to create Angular Service: ng g s service-folder/service-name
        5. to create module with lazy loading: ng g m [myModule_name] --route [myRoute_path_name] --module [routing_module_name]
        6. to create userdefined pipe: ng g p pipe-folder/pipe-name
        7. to create Angular Guards: ng g g Guards-folder/guard-name



                Basic Features
            -----------------------

        1. Module: can hold more components and also import packages to create or design page
            - root module: AppModule
        2. Component: have selector, template, stylesheet and a ts file 
            - root component: AppComponent (only root component selector can be given in index.html page)
        3. Decorator: to add metadata (data inside another data) to a file
        4. Selectors: used to display components in html page using a tag
        5. Data Binding: data shairing within a component (between ts and its html file)
            - One way Binding: data shairing only in one direction at a time
                - component to view
                    - String Interpolation: use  {{property-name}} in html tag as content 
                    - Property Binding: bind class property with attribute of html tag
                        [attribute]="property-name"
                - view to component
                    - event Binding: (event-name)="function-name()"
                    - event Binding using $event: (event-name)="function-name($event)"
                    - event Binding using template reference variable: (event-name)="function-name(template-reference variable)"
                        - template reference variable: syntax: #variable-name
            - Two way Binding: data shairing in both direction at the same time
                - Template Driven Forms:
                    - use ngModel attribute: syntax- [(ngModel)]="class-property"
                        - import FormsModule in Module
        6. Angular Rounting: set up path for component
            - use AppRoutingModule file
            - router-outlet selector helps to navigate user requested page
            - routerLink: to navigate from one page another using html
        7. Dependency Injection: when two classes (one should be userdefined class and another shoulde be predefined class) are Dependent then dependent class instance can be assigned to the other class using its constructor
            syntax: constructor(access-specifier variable-name:dependent-class-name){}
        8. Angular Forms
            - Template Driven Forms: design html page first
                - Validation
            - Model Driven Forms: design model for the page first in ts file
        9. Angular Service: used to define common logic that can be shared with any classes
            - communication (data shairing) between userdefined components
        10. Lazy loading / on-demand loading Module: 
        11. Asynchronous function handling: RxJS Library
            - Observable Techniques
            - To resolve Observable, we have to subscribe the same
                - next : success response
                - error : client or server errors
                - complete : complete
        12. API Call: use of HttpClient class (get,post,put,delete)
            - Import HttpClientModule in module
        13. Life cycle Hooks of Angular Component
            - OnChanges
            - OnInit : Called on first initialization happed in the component (ngOnInit)
            - DoCheck
            - OnDestroy
        14. Angular Directives : used to add additional behavior to html elements 
            - Component Directives : selector used to view a component in html page
            - Structural Directives : used to change html structure by adding/removing html elements
                - ngIf : if condition satisfied then it display html element in dom else it removes the html element from dom
                syntax: *ngIf="condition"
                - ngFor : to display an array item as a html element in dom
                syntax : *ngFor="let variable-name of array-name"
                - ngSwitch :
            - Attribute Directives : provide style to html elements
                - ngClass : specify the style using the class name and it can be bind with class property
        15. ngForm: binds it to a form to track aggregate form value and validation status.
        16. ActivatedRoute : Provides access to information about a route associated with a component
        17. Angular Pipes: to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display.
        18. Data communication between userdefined components
            - using Angular service
            - using parent child communication
                - data shairing from parent to child : Input Decorator (can only share values)
                - data shairing from child to parent : Output Decorator (can only share events)
            - using signals
        19. Angular Guards :  control the accessibility of a route based on condition
